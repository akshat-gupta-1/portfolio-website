        I'm Akshat, a full-stack developer from India. I'm all about creating
        captivating websites that not only function seamlessly but also look
        stunning â€“ just like the one you're exploring right now.
        <br />
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in the intriguing world of
        podcasting, sparking thought-provoking conversations and sharing
        insights. Beyond that, I'm a passionate table tennis player, always up
        for a thrilling match, and a curious internet explorer, uncovering
        fascinating tidbits like did you know, the unicorn is Scotland's
        national animal.
